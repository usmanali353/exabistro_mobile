# The following section is specific to Flutter.
flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/
    - assets/newnotfounds.jpg
    - assets/i18n/
    - assets/emptycart.png
    - assets/noDataFound.png
    - assets/caspian11.png
    - assets/gifimage2.gif
    - assets/deliveryBoygif.gif


#  assets:
#    - assets/ic_forwards.png
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  fonts:
    - family: poppins
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/poppins/Poppins-Thin.ttf
          weight: 100
        - asset: assets/fonts/poppins/Poppins-ExtraLight.ttf
          weight: 200
        - asset: assets/fonts/poppins/Poppins-Light.ttf
          weight: 300
        - asset: assets/fonts/poppins/Poppins-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: assets/fonts/poppins/Poppins-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500

          weight: 600

          weight: 800
        - asset: assets/fonts/poppins/Poppins-Black.ttf
          weight: 900
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
